Overview
This project implemented experiments related to the manuscript "Synergistic Estimation of Six Air Pollutant Concentrations Using a Multitask Network with Uncertain Losses: A Case Study of Sichuan Province, China". The project aims to proposed a multitask neural network to collaboratively estimate seamless six common atmospheric pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, O₃, CO, NO₂, and SO₂) concentration from remote sensing data.
